Define the goal:
    Create a game where users guess a word by pressing letters.

Designing the script:
	X 1) Create an array of words (novels).
    X 2) Create a variable to choose a random word.
    X 3) Create a variable to store the answer array.
    X 4) Create a variable to store the remaining letters in the word.
    X 5) Create a variable to show the number of wins.
    X 6) Create a variable called "emptyLetters" with a "_".
    7) User inputs a letter using onkeyup (?)
    8) The computer checks to see if the letter is valid (A-Z), and then checks to see if the letter is part of the word.
        a) Uses an if/else if/else statement.
        b) if (letter is valid && in the word) {
               display letter in word
            }
            
            else if (letter is valid && not in the word) {
                display "try again" message
            }

            else (letter is invalid) {
                return message error
            }
    9) Display the remaining number of guesses to user.
    10) End the game at win or when the guesses return to 0.
    11) Restart the game.
